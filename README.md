## Requirements ##
To use the Mollie API client, the following things are required:

+ Get yourself a free [Mollie account](https://www.mollie.com/signup). No sign up costs.
+ Now you're ready to use the Mollie API client in test mode.
+ Follow [a few steps](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/?modal=onboarding) to enable payment methods in live mode, and let us handle the rest.
+ Up-to-date OpenSSL (or other SSL/TLS toolkit)

For leveraging [Mollie Connect](https://docs.mollie.com/oauth/overview) (advanced use cases only), it is recommended to be familiar with the OAuth2 protocol.


## API parity

Checks to the API changelog are performed constantly to ensure API parity and compatibility, however it might happen that not all the changes are implemented right away.

For checking all the related tasks you can check the issues labeled with the [API parity](https://github.com/VictorAvelar/mollie-api-go/labels/API%20parity) label.

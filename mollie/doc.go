// Package mollie is a wrapper around Mollie's REST API.
//
// See: https://www.mollie.com/en/developers
//
// The Mollie API implements a Representational state transfer (REST) architecture.
//
// Sounds technical, but itâ€™s really quite easy. It mainly breaks down to HTTP-methods
// GET, PATCH, POST and DELETE matching the operations to read, update, create and delete.
//
// REST also implies a nice and clean structure for URLs or endpoints.
// This means you can reach any part of the Mollie API on https://api.mollie.com/v2/ adding
// the name of the resource you want to interact with.
